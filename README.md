# TantrixSevenTilesPuzzleResolver - Java
This is a small application for solving [Tantrix] (http://tantrix.com/) Seven tiles puzzles that I have put together to learn functional programming using Java 8, [Javaslang] (http://www.javaslang.io/) and [Javactic] (https://github.com/javactic/javactic).

Previously I've made a Scala-based implementation that can be found [here] (https://github.com/jorander/TantrixSevenTilesPuzzleResolver).
